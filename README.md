# Cache-Writing-Policies-WriteBack-and-WriteThrough
This repo contains code for Write Back and Write Through Cache Write Policies Implemented in C. This is more of a simulator for student understanding of the Write Policies rather than actual cache memory interaction. The code takes input from the user using a menu driven program and writes into existing text files cache.txt and memory.txt.
